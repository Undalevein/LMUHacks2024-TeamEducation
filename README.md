# LMUHacks2024 - New MyLMU Website
## Created by Wesley Ng, Joshua Lee, Sammy Santos, and Simon Worku

### A Better Vision
  In order to promote better education for all LMU students, we have taken it uppon ourselves to recreate the MyLMU webpage in a way that makes sense. Our webpage has easy navigation, more useful links front and center, and an improved layout. It has all our links organized neatly on the side with logos to make each page clear to the users. users can easily check their Lion Mail and Student Profile by clicking on the icons at the top right of the homepage. Important announcements are in the middle of the page, in large yellow boxes so you cannot miss it! We also have a calendar sidescroll bar that shows off current and upcoming events happening on campus to keep out student body informed.

### Extra Features
  Users can type notes to remind themselves of tasks to do on the right side of our webpage. These notes are useful and will be saved even if our users exit the webpage!
